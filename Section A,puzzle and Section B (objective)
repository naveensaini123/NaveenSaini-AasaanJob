PUZZLE
We need to figure out in hour. We need 10 rats to figure out the poisoned bottle.
IN THIS QUESTION WE WILL USE BINARY CONCEPT.
The result is based on binary number system. 
 As We get 10 using[Log100] and there are 10 rats so we can figure it out using binary number.
The idea is to number bottles from 1 to 100 and write their corresponding binary numbers on the bottle.
Each rat is assigned a position in the binary numbers written on bottles. 
Let us take an example. Rat 1 represents first bit in every bottle, 
rat 2 represents second bit and so on. 
If rat numbers 3, 5 and 7 die, then bottle number 84 (Binary 001010100) is poisoned.
